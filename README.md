# Exploratory data Analysis

In this repository you can find two projects I worked on as part of my Data science and engineering certification at Jedha Bootcamp

## Speed dating project

**This project's aim was to understand what makes people attracted to each other thanks to a small dataset gathered by tinder**

For more information you can consult the dedicated README file inside the folder.

## Steam marketplace project

**In constrast, this project was centered around a much much bigger dataset gathered from steam's marketplace. This projects aim was to study the current videogame market for Ubisoft, who wanted to release a new game**

For more information you can consult the dedicated README file inside the folder.
