# Steam marketplace EDA

## Project description

A company would like to release a new revolutionary videogame! They asked me to conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.

## Goals
To carry out different levels of analysis :
- Analysis at the "macro" level

    - Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?
    - What are the best rated games?
    - How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount?
    - What are the most represented languages?

- Genres analysis
    - What are the most represented genres?
    - Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?
    - What are the most lucrative genres?

## Dataset
The dataset can be retrieved here:
```s3://full-stack-bigdata-datasets/Big_Data/Project_Steam/steam_game_output.json``` 

Although given the size of the dataset, I recommend that it is opened in an IDE suited for big data such as Databricks


## Usage
Given that this is a Big data project, the whole analysis is contained in a databricks notebook that can be consulted [here](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/6361509703842526/1113797785352350/4149004725267014/latest.html) and will be available for six months starting January 9th 2024 (will be updated again then).
